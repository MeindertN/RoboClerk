# RoboClerk

Aims to become a documentation automation system for SaMD. Could be used to partially document an ISO62304 compliant development process. The goal is for this system to interface with a variety of systems used in software development such as software lifecycle management systems, universal artifact repository manager, version control systems as well as the source code of a project.
