# RoboClerk

RoboClerk is a powerful software package that is specifically designed to meet the needs of smaller teams working on medical device software and SaMD. One of the key advantages of using RoboClerk is that it allows teams to work in the same way they normally would, without having to worry about generating the majority of the documentation needed to show compliance with ISO62304. Instead, RoboClerk retrieves the artifacts that are generated as part of the team's normal development process and uses them to automatically generate the necessary documentation. This not only saves time and reduces the risk of errors, but it also ensures that compliance requirements are met without having to take time away from development activities. RoboClerk follows the "Documentation-as-code" philosophy, which means that documentation is treated as a code artifact and managed in the same way as code. The software is also designed to be run as part of a CI/CD pipeline, which further streamlines the development process and ensures that compliance requirements are met at every stage.

The templates RoboClerk uses to generate the documentation are in Asciidoc format to ensure that the generated documentation is consistent and follows a standardized format. These templates can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of each project and, because they are ascii files, are stored with the source code in version control, ensuring precise configuration management of the documentation. This means that teams can easily track changes to the documentation and roll back to earlier versions if necessary, just as they would with their code. By using Asciidoc format, RoboClerk also makes it easy to include diagrams (for example, plantUML etc. through the use of [Kroki](https://kroki.io/)), images, and other visual aids in the generated documentation, which can help to improve its overall clarity and usefulness.
