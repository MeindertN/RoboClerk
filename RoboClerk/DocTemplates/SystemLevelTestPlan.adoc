== Introduction

=== Purpose

The purpose of this @@Document:Title()@@ (@@Document:Abbreviation()@@) document is to define and outline the testing activities, objectives, scope, and methods that will be employed to evaluate the performance, safety, and reliability of @@Config:SoftwareName()@@ @@Config:SoftwareVersion()@@, a medical device software developed by @@Config:CompanyName()@@ This SLTP has been prepared in compliance with the ISO 62304 standard for the development of medical device software, and it aims to ensure that @@Config:SoftwareName()@@ @@Config:SoftwareVersion()@@ meets all the necessary requirements for safe and effective use in its intended healthcare environment.

=== Document Conventions

This @@Document:Abbreviation()@@ document includes two distinct types of test cases: Manual Test Cases and Automated Test Cases. Each type of test case is organized in its own separate section within the document. The format and content for each type of test case are described below:

==== Manual Test Cases

Manual Test Cases are designed to be executed by human testers. Each Manual Test Case includes the following information:

* Test Case ID: A unique identifier with a link back to the Software Lifecycle Management System.
* Test Case Revision: The revision number, date, and time of the test case.
* Parent ID: One or more links to parent software requirement items, along with a brief description for each linked software requirement.
* Test Case Title: A brief, descriptive title of the test case.
* Test Case Steps: A series of steps to execute the test case, including:
** Step Number: The sequential number of the test step.
** Action: The action to be performed by the tester.
** Expected Result: The expected outcome of the action.
** Actual Result: The actual outcome of the action, recorded by the tester.
** Test Step Status: The status of the test step, indicated as either "pass" or "fail".

==== Automated Test Cases

Automated Test Cases are designed to run automatically as part of the build process. Each Automated Test Case includes the following information:

* Test Case ID: A unique identifier with a link back to the Software Lifecycle Management System.
* Test Case Revision: The revision number, date, and time of the test case.
* Parent ID: One or more links to parent software requirement items, along with a brief description for each linked software requirement.
* Test Case Title: A brief, descriptive title of the test case.
* Test Case Steps: A series of steps to execute the test case, including:
** Step Number: The sequential number of the test step.
** Action: The action to be performed by the automated test.
** Expected Result: The expected outcome of the action.

=== Intended Audience

=== Unit Tests Brief

This is a table containing an overview of all unit tests of RoboClerk. The different formats of the identifier is because two different approaches were used to document the unit tests. In the first approach we used the unit test function name to document it and in the second approach unit tests are annotated. The annotated approach is the superior approach.
