== Introduction

=== Purpose

The purpose of this document is to specify the architecture and system design of 
@@Config:SoftwareName()@@ @@Config:SoftwareVersion()@@ developed by @@Config:CompanyName()@@. 
It tracks the information required to define architecture and system design, in order to give the development 
team guidance on architecture of the system to be developed. The intended audience is the project manager, 
project team, and development team. Some portions of this document such as the user interface (UI) may, on occasion, 
be shared with the client/user and other stakeholders whose UI input/approval is needed. If trace to this document is desired
Traceability information can be created by listing the software requirement ID with the design implementation in the text. 

=== Definitions

*SOFTWARE ITEM* – Any identifiable part of a computer program. All levels of composition, including the top and bottom
levels, can be called software items. (See IEC62304.)

*SOFTWARE UNIT* – The lowest level of software item. This level is not further decomposed.

== Testing Section

Here we will test a variety of in document trace tags referring to software requirements.

@@Trace:SWR(id=10)@@ The text that has the trace link
@@Trace:SWR(Id=1234321)@@ the parameter names are case insensitive
@@Trace:SWR(id=12)@@ And the second trace link
Just a line of text.
@@Trace:SWR(id=3)@@ @@Trace:SR(id=4)@@ Two more trace links

@@Trace:SYS(id=2)@@ And a random product requirement trace link, is not supposed to show up in the document

@@Trace:SWR(id=89)@@ non existent software trace

@@@SLMS:SYS(itemID=11)

@@@

The above just tests to see if we can include a single product requirement

@@@Comment:general()
Things that are in comment tags will be removed when the document is processed. These comment blocks, when placed
in templates, can help authors with using the template in the right way. Alternatively, you can use asciidoc
comment tags too.

Here is a reference to a document @@Ref:RandomTestDocument()@@

Check out the @@Ref:SoftwareSystemLevelTestPlan()@@ (@@ref:SoftwareSystemLevelTestPlan(short=true)@@)

We can import excel spreadsheets into our document in the following way:
@@FILE:ExcelTable(fileName=testspreadsheet.xlsx,range=A3:C6,workSheet=Sheet1)@@

Here is some SOUP that is included in the documents.

@@@SLMS:SOUP()
This tag retrieves all SOUP from the SLMS and shows it here.
@@@
       
A summary table version of all the SOUP that are installed by the user

@@@SLMS:SOUP(brief=true,SOUPInstalledByUser=true)
This shows a summary table for all the SOUP that are installed by the user
@@@

Next are some docContent statements. These are required statements that must show up in documentation (usually the user manual)

@@@SLMS:DCT()
This will be replaced by the available documentation content items.
