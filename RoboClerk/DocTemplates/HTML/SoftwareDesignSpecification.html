    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of this @@Document:Title()@@ (@@Document:Abbreviation()@@) document is to detail the architecture and system design for the @@Config:SoftwareName()@@ @@Config:SoftwareVersion()@@ developed by @@Config:CompanyName()@@. This document provides essential guidance to the development team, ensuring a cohesive and well-structured system. Portions related to the user interface (UI) may be shared with clients/users and other stakeholders for their input and approval. Traceability to this document can be established by linking software requirement IDs with their corresponding design implementations.
    </p>

    <h3>Document Conventions</h3>
    <p>This @@Document:Abbreviation()@@ document follows specific conventions to ensure consistency and clarity for all stakeholders involved in the software development process. Key conventions include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sections:</strong> The document is organized into distinct sections, each addressing a particular aspect of the software design, such as architecture, components, interfaces, and data flow.</li>
        <li><strong>Terminology:</strong> Consistent terminology is used throughout the document, with a Definitions Section provided for any domain-specific terms, acronyms, or abbreviations.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagrams:</strong> Visual representations, such as flowcharts, UML diagrams, or state-transition diagrams, are used to illustrate key concepts and relationships between components.</li>
        <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> Software requirement IDs are linked to their corresponding design implementations in the text, ensuring traceability and alignment with the ISO 62304 standard.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
    <p>This @@Document:Abbreviation()@@ document is intended for various stakeholders involved in the development, management, and regulatory oversight of the @@Config:SoftwareName()@@ @@Config:SoftwareVersion()@@ medical device software development. The primary intended audience includes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Software Developers:</strong> This document provides guidance on the architecture and system design, offering insights into the software's structure, components, and relationships for a well-designed solution.</li>
        <li><strong>Management:</strong> This document helps management monitor progress, allocate resources, and make informed decisions based on the software design and its alignment with requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory Agencies:</strong> The SDS demonstrates compliance with ISO 62304 and supports regulatory submission, ensuring the software meets safety and efficacy standards.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SOFTWARE ITEM</strong> – Any identifiable part of a computer program. All levels of composition, including the top and bottom levels, can be called software items. (See IEC62304.)</li>
        <li><strong>SOFTWARE UNIT</strong> – The lowest level of software item. This level is not further decomposed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Image Section</h2>

    <p>Roboclerk expects images to be stored in the media directory (or a subdirectory of the media directory). Here is an example image:</p>

    <figure>
        <figcaption class="image-caption">A nice image</figcaption>
        <img src="media/griffin-wooldridge-unsplash.jpg" width="365" alt="image">
    </figure>

    <h2>Testing Section</h2>

    <p>
        This document is not meant to model a real design document. Instead it is a testing document for a variety of RoboClerk tags. Here we will test a variety of in document trace tags referring to software requirements. Please refer also to the template source to fully understand what is going on in this section.
    </p>

    <p>@@Trace:SWR(id=10)@@ The text that has the trace link</p>
    <p>@@Trace:SWR(Id=1234321)@@ the parameter names are case insensitive</p>
    <p>@@Trace:SWR(id=12)@@ And the second trace link</p>
    <p>Just a line of text.</p>
    <p>@@Trace:SWR(id=3)@@ @@Trace:SR(id=4)@@ Two more trace links</p>
    <p>@@Trace:SYS(id=2)@@ And a random product requirement trace link, is not supposed to show up in the document</p>
    <p>@@Trace:SWR(id=89)@@ non existent software trace</p>

    @@@SLMS:SYS(itemID=11)@@@

    <p>The above just tests to see if we can include a single system requirement</p>

    @@@Comment:general()
    Things that are in comment tags will be removed when the document is processed. These comment blocks, when placed
    in templates, can help authors with using the template in the right way. Alternatively, you can use asciidoc
    comment tags too.
    @@@

    <p>Here is a reference to a document @@Ref:RandomTestDocument()@@</p>

    <p>Check out the @@Ref:SoftwareSystemLevelTestPlan(title=true,abbr=true)@@</p>

    <p>
        We can import excel spreadsheets (e.g. testspreadsheet.xlsx) into our document. See the template to see how this was done for this example:<br />
        @@FILE:ExcelTable(fileName=testspreadsheet.xlsx,range=A3:C6,workSheet=Sheet1)@@
    </p>

    <p>Here is some SOUP that is included in the documents.</p>

    @@@SLMS:SOUP()
    This tag retrieves all SOUP from the SLMS and shows it here.
    @@@

    <p>A summary table version of all the SOUP that are installed by the user</p>

    @@@SLMS:SOUP(brief=true,SOUPInstalledByUser=true)
    This shows a summary table for all the SOUP that are installed by the user
    @@@

    <p>Next are some docContent statements. These are required statements that must show up in documentation (usually the user manual)</p>

    @@@SLMS:DCT()
    This will be replaced by the available documentation content items.
    @@@

    <h2>PlantUML diagram with Kroki</h2>

    <p>The RoboClerk docker container has Kroki support built in. It allows you to add a variety of different text to image tool outputs including PlantUML to your documents:</p>

@@@WEB:krokidiagram(type=plantuml, format=png, caption=Example workflow diagram with PlantUML)
skinparam defaultTextAlignment center
!pragma useVerticalIf on

while(RoboClerk is Awesome?) is (yes)
    :Keep using RoboClerk;
    while(Medical Device Software needs to comply with ISO62304) is (yes)
        :Keep using RoboClerk;
    endwhile (no)
