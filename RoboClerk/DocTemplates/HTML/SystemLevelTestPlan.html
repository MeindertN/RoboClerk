        <li><strong>Test Case ID:</strong> A unique identifier with a link back to the Software Lifecycle Management System.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Case Revision:</strong> The revision number, date, and time of the test case.</li>
        <li><strong>Parent ID:</strong> One or more links to parent software requirement items, along with a brief description for each linked software requirement.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Case Title:</strong> A brief, descriptive title of the test case.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Test Case Steps:</strong> A series of steps to execute the test case, including:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step Number:</strong> The sequential number of the test step.</li>
                <li><strong>Action:</strong> The action to be performed by the tester.</li>
                <li><strong>Expected Result:</strong> The expected outcome of the action.</li>
                <li><strong>Actual Result:</strong> The actual outcome of the action, recorded by the tester.</li>
                <li><strong>Test Step Status:</strong> The status of the test step, indicated as either "pass" or "fail".</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Automated Test Cases</h4>
    <p>Automated Test Cases are designed to run automatically as part of the build process. Each Automated Test Case includes the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Test Case ID:</strong> A unique identifier with a link back to the Software Lifecycle Management System.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Case Revision:</strong> The revision number, date, and time of the test case.</li>
        <li><strong>Parent ID:</strong> One or more links to parent software requirement items, along with a brief description for each linked software requirement.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Case Title:</strong> A brief, descriptive title of the test case.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Test Case Steps:</strong> A series of steps to execute the test case, including:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step Number:</strong> The sequential number of the test step.</li>
                <li><strong>Action:</strong> The action to be performed by the automated test.</li>
                <li><strong>Expected Result:</strong> The expected outcome of the action.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Unit Tests Brief</h3>
    <p>
        This is a table containing an overview of all unit tests of RoboClerk. The different formats of the identifier is because two different approaches were used to document the unit tests. In the first approach we used the unit test function name to document it and in the second approach unit tests are annotated. The annotated approach is the superior approach.

    <h3>Automated Test Result Checking</h3>
    <p>
        Using the Test Results File Plugin it is possible for RoboClerk to ingest test results and provide feedback about failures or mismatches.
