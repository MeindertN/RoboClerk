# This configuration file contains the configuration for the project that RoboClerk
# is running on. It also contains key value pairs for items that are needed in the 
# documentation such are the name of the software and the version etc.

# Truth items are those items retrieved from the source of truth (e.g. the SLMS). Specify how the these truth trace entities
# should be called. This will ensure that the trace output makes sense in your context.

# Document specification, a specification should be created for each document that RoboClerk should know about. This 
# can include documents that can be referenced but are not maintained or generated by RoboClerk. 
# The document specification needs to have an identifier, a title, an abbreviation and a file location (can be empty or 
# omitted for documents not managed by RoboClerk).
# Optionally, you can specify post processing steps as commandline commands that RoboClerk will execute in order after it 
# has produced the markdown versions of the documents. Each document should be specified below in the following format:
#
#	[Document.<IDENTIFIER>]
#		title = "<TITLE OF THE DOCUMENT>"
#		abbreviation = "<ABBREVIATION>"
#		template = "<TEMPLATE FILE LOCATION>"
#		[[Document.<IDENTIFIER>.Command]]
#			executable = "<PATH_TO_EXECUTABLE>"
#			arguments = "<ARGUMENTS>"
#			workingDirectory = "<WORKING_DIRECTORY>"
#			ignoreErrors = "False"
#		[[Document.<IDENTIFIER>.Command]]
#			executable = "<PATH_TO_EXECUTABLE>"
#			arguments = "<ARGUMENTS>"
#			workingDirectory = "<WORKING_DIRECTORY>"
#			ignoreErrors = "False"
#
# RoboClerk will check the command exit code. If the exit code indicates an error, RoboClerk throws an exception and stops  
# processing. To ignore exit codes set ignoreErrors = "True". In the commands one can use the %OUTPUTFILE% variable to 
# indicate the location of the output file that should be processed. The variable %OUTPUTDIR% is the output directory.  
# Note that the value of %OUTPUTDIR% is provided in the general configuration file. RoboClerk will assign these variables
# the correct values.

# Use the trace config to configure what documents shall be traced and what in those documents must trace.
# Two levels of requirements are distinguished, product and software requirements. In the table below, both
# these levels are represented as tables. In each table all trace documents are listed in the order in which
# they will be traced. Each of them is assigned a list indicating how the trace should be validated and what
# requirements should trace to the target doc. It is possible to indicate that only a subset of requirements
# (based on the category of the requirements) must trace. Multiple categories can be indicated. To indicate
# that the trace should be complete (all requirements must trace to the target) use the ALL keyword. To 
# indicate that incomplete trace is allowed, use the OPTIONAL keyword.
