# Use the trace config to configure what documents shall be traced and what in those documents must trace.
# Two levels of requirements are distinguished, product and software requirements. In the table below, both
# these levels are represented as tables. In each table all trace documents are listed in the order in which
# they will be traced. Each of them is assigned a list indicating how the trace should be validated and what
# requirements should trace to the target doc. It is possible to indicate that only a subset of requirements
# (based on the catagory of the requirements) must trace. Multiple catagories can be indicated. To indicate
# that the trace should be complete (all requirements must trace to the target) use the ALL keyword. To 
# indicate that incomplete trace is allowed, use the OPTIONAL keyword.
